HAB Taxi Services Company System
Project Synopsis
Overview:

The HAB Taxi Services Company System is designed to streamline the operations and financial management of a taxi service company. This comprehensive, menu-driven software application enables users to manage employee records, track company revenues and expenses, automate recurring fees, and generate financial reports, all through a simple text-based interface.

Objectives:

Employee Management:

Facilitate the entry and maintenance of employee records, focusing on drivers. This includes managing their personal details, employment status, and financial obligations to the company.
Financial Tracking:

Accurately record and categorize company revenues and expenses, ensuring that all financial transactions are documented for analysis and reporting.
Automated Processes:

Implement an automatic monthly fee system that charges stand fees to drivers who own their cars at the beginning of each month, updating relevant revenue records and employee balances accordingly.
Reporting and Analysis:

Generate detailed financial reports to assess company performance, such as profit listings, driver financial standings, and a corporate summary report that integrates data from various sources to support strategic decision-making.
Features:

User-Friendly Menu:

A simple, intuitive menu guides users through available options, allowing them to perform tasks such as entering new employees, recording revenues and expenses, tracking car rentals, and accessing financial reports.
Data Persistence:

Utilize CSV files for persistent data storage, ensuring that employee records, revenue, and expense data are saved and retrievable across program sessions.
Automated Fee Processing:

On the first day of each month, the system automatically applies stand fees to eligible drivers, reflecting these transactions in both revenue and employee balance records.
Comprehensive Reporting:

Options for generating various reports, including profit listings and driver financial standings, provide valuable insights into the company's financial health. A corporate summary report synthesizes information across data sources, facilitating high-level analysis and decision-making.
Calculated Fields:

Automatically calculate and display financial metrics, such as tax and total revenue amounts, based on user inputs during transaction entry.
Implementation Strategy:

Data Structures: Define classes for employees, revenues, and expenses to encapsulate relevant data and operations.
File Handling: Implement robust functions to read and write CSV files, ensuring data integrity and ease of use.
Automated Processes: Develop logic to manage automated fee processing based on system date checks.
Menu System: Create a flexible main menu loop to handle user input and invoke appropriate functionality.
The HAB Taxi Services Company System ultimately aims to enhance operational efficiency and financial transparency, empowering the company to effectively manage its resources and drive informed business decisions.
